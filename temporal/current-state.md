## Current State Analysis

### **Identified Issues:**

1. **Fragile DOM Selectors**: The code relies on CSS classes like `.text-base`, `div[class*="group"]`, `.markdown`, `.prose`, `.whitespace-pre-wrap` which are likely to break when OpenAI updates ChatGPT's interface.

2. **Inconsistent Message Detection Logic**: 
   - Markdown exporter: Uses `div[class*="group"]` and detects user via `!!group.querySelector('img')`
   - PDF exporter: Uses `.text-base` and alternates with `index % 2 === 0`

3. **Outdated Selectors**: ChatGPT's interface has evolved significantly, and these selectors may no longer work reliably.

4. **Content Processing Issues**:
   - Code block detection relies on specific class patterns that may have changed
   - Image/canvas replacement is basic
   - No handling for ChatGPT's newer features (plugins, web browsing, file uploads, etc.)

5. **Button Placement Logic**: The userscripts add buttons to `nav` which may not be the ideal location in current ChatGPT interface.

6. **Limited Error Handling**: No fallback mechanisms if selectors fail.

7. **Missing Features**: No conversation title extraction, thread handling, or support for newer ChatGPT features.
